In Hearts’ 1-0 victory, he played well and kept a clean sheet.</p><p>Gordon signed a five-year contract with Sunderland in August 2007. The £9 million fee was the highest paid for a goalkeeper by a British club until Manchester United paid around £17 million for David de Gea in 2011. Gordon made his Sunderland debut against Tottenham Hotspur in the first game of the 2007-08 Premier League season, keeping a clean sheet as his side won 1-0.</p><p>Gordon was linked with a move to Celtic in 2011 and 2012, but he did not sign with another club for another two years due to knee injuries. During his time away from football, he was a regular on television. Gordon began coaching for Dumbarton after meeting Ian Murray while working on television.</p><p>Gordon joined Celtic in July 2014. On July 19, he made his Celtic debut, appearing in the first half of a pre-season friendly against Dynamo Dresden.</p><p>Gordon was given the number 1 jersey for the 2015-16 season, replacing the number 26 shirt he wore when he was signed.

In his second stint with Hearts, he helped them reach the 2020 Scottish Cup Final with key saves in a semi-final win over Hibs.</p><p>Gordon captained the team against Ayr United in his 200th appearance for the club. He became the 75th player in Hearts history to accomplish this feat. His 66th shutout came in a 3-0 win for the Hearts.</p><p>He finished the season with eight consecutive clean sheets. Gordon was defeated by teammate Liam Boyce for Championship Player of the Year, but he did make the division’s Team of the Year.</p><p>Gordon made his debut for Scotland’s under-21 team in a 2-1 win over Israel in September 2002 at Hamilton. Over the next year, he appeared four more times for the under-21 team.</p><p>Gordon made his full international debut for Scotland on May 30, 2004, in a 4-1 victory over Trinidad and Tobago at Easter Road. Scotland began their World Cup qualifying campaign against Slovenia on September 8, 2004 at Hampden Park. Gordon played goal and kept a clean sheet, despite Scotland’s poor performance in a goalless draw.</p><p>Gordon established himself as Scotland’s first-choice goalkeeper throughout the campaign and under Vogts’ successor Walter Smith, playing in all ten of Scotland’s qualifying matches.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Craig Gordon Children: Meet Ace and Axel</h2><p>Craig Gordon has two children from his relationship with Summer Harl: Ace Harlow, born in 2021, and Axel, born in 2022.
